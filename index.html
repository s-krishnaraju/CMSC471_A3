            <p style="font-size:larger;">The data for this visualization comes from the OECD Greenhouse Gas Emissions
                dataset, which covers emissions across many countries and sectors. Initially, I thought about comparing
                GHG emissions across multiple countries, but I realized that would make the visualization too complex.
                To keep it clear and focused, I decided to narrow the scope to just the United States, which also made
                it easier to set up the contrasting black hat visualization later.

                For the white hat visualization, I chose to display the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the U.S.
                from 2001 to 2022, measured in thousands of tonnes of CO2-equivalent. I used a simple time series line
                plot to show how emissions changed over time. This design allows for an easy-to-understand view of the
                data, highlighting the steady but gradual decline in emissions without any major spikes or fluctuations.
                The visualization is clear and straightforward, with labeled axes and a simple title, ensuring that the
                data is easy to interpret. The trend shown—emissions slowly decreasing over time—accurately reflects the
                real-world data, which has seen a consistent reduction in GHGs in the U.S. in recent years. By focusing
                on transparency and simplicity in the visualization, I'm able to present the data in an honest and
                accessible way, with no distractions or misleading elements, which aligns with the purpose of a good
                white hat visualization.

        <h2>Black Hat Visualization</h2>

                For the black hat visualization, I wanted to create a narrative that leads the viewer to a completely
                different—and misleading—conclusion than the white hat version. Since my white hat visualization showed
                a slight, steady decrease in total U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over time, I set out to design a
                chart that instead suggested a significant increase in GHG emissions, even though that’s not what the
                full data shows. To do this, I explored the OECD dataset more closely and noticed that it allows you to
                break down emissions by individual pollutants. That’s when I found my angle: Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),
                a small subset of overall GHGs, have actually increased over time—by nearly 80% from their 2001 levels.
                This gave me just the misleading trend I needed. There are a few key ways I intentionally skewed the
                visualization. First, the dataset: instead of showing total emissions like I did in the white hat, I
                focused only on HFCs, which paints a very different picture. Second, the title: I deliberately left out
                any mention of HFCs and just called the chart “Change in U.S. Greenhouse Gas Pollution”. While
                technically not false—HFCs are greenhouse gases—it gives the impression that the chart is referring to
                total GHG emissions, which it isn’t. Lastly, I changed the measurement. In the white hat, I used
                thousands of tonnes of CO₂-equivalent, which gives you a sense of scale. But because HFCs make up such a
                small portion of total emissions, that would’ve made the increase look almost insignificant. So instead,
                I plotted percent change from the base year (2001) and removed any mention of actual units, making the
                increase look dramatic and harder to question at first glance. In the end, this black hat visualization
                is deceptive in three ways: 1) it uses a misleading subset of the data (HFCs instead of total GHGs), 2)
                the title omits important context, and 3) the data is transformed into percent change to exaggerate the
                trend. These subtle changes work together to completely flip the narrative—presenting a world where
                emissions seem to be rising sharply, when the broader data tells the opposite story.
